                <h2>Get To School</h2>
                <p>Get To School is a smash hit Indie success about getting to school... presumably.  While Playing Get to School you will have an unmatched experience when compared<br>
                    to the feeble games known as Minecraft, Roblox, and even Fortnite.  This game is the definition of peak and fun with friends having a vast amount of content and <br>
                    an unlimited amount of things to do.  A lot of work was put into this game in order to make it fun and enjoyable for the masses that play it and I hope that everyone enjoys
                    the game as much as I do. </p>

                <h3>Market Stall</h3>
                <p>The market Stall NPC is very important in Get to School since she allows you to buy fruit such as apples or carrots.  You are able to find her once you enter the boulder pass.</p>
                <h3>Banker</h3>
                <a href="img/Banker.png"><img src="img/Banker.png" alt=""></a>
                <p>The banker NPC is very useful and convenient in Get to Schol 5 since he allows you to store your gold and access it at a future time preventing you from losing it.  You can find him inside of the starting house.</p>
