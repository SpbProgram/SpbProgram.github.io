                    <p>The market Stall NPC is very important in Get to School since she allows you to buy fruit such as
                        apples or carrots. You are able to find her once you enter the boulder pass.</p>
                    <h3>Banker</h3>
                    <a href="img/Banker.png"><img src="img/Banker.png" alt=""></a>
                    <p>The banker NPC is very useful and convenient in Get to Schol 5 since he allows you to store your
                        gold and access it at a future time preventing you from losing it. You can find him inside of
                        the starting house.</p>
