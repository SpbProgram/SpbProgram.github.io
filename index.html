                <img src="img/Gamescreen.png" alt="Gamescreen" class="Left">
                <p>Get To School is a smash hit Indie success about getting to school... presumably.  Throughout my entire marking period three, I have 
                    worked on my game, Get to School 5, and put as much effort as I could to make it a good game.  RPG Maker MZ was a really valueable 
                    resource in my education on programming this year and allowed me to learn important things in programming such as Flow Charts and 
                    conditional branches.  If you wish to learn more click <a href="gameguide.html">here</a>!</p>
