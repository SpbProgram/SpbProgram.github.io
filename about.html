                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Like stated on my Home page, I am a Honors student at York Tech and have a few things I do in my free time that I enjoy.  One of the things I enjoy the most is watching 
                    anime.  Some that I have watched are: Jujutsu Kaisen, Bleach, Demon Slayer, and Dragon Ball.  I have watched many more but that is just a few that are currently 
                    relevant.  I also often play games like Garrys mod or Fortnite with my friends to pass time when I'm not doing homework.  My family also comes from the Dominican Republic
                    and has lived in America for almost 30 years.  Growing in a Hispanic family, I was able to learn spanish and I am bilingual. </p>

                <h2>Why I attended York Tech</h2>
                <p>Growing up in New York, I was surround by a lot of technology, in fact one of my favorite things to do as a kid was play on my Wii.  This constant environment of 
                    technology led me to become facinated in the topic of computers and how they work.  As I continuted to grow, this facination of technology only grew along with me.
                    When I found out about York Tech, I was intrigued about the programs and when I found out about their IT branch I knew I had to apply and try my hardest to get accepted 
                    into the school. </p>
